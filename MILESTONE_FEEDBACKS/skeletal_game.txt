+15 Not visible but a good attempt. Many parts of the game are refactorized using the ECS pattern.

Issues:
-15 The collision system is not working in this version.

Feedback:
I appreciate your efforts into the code architecture. Though it may be a lot of work at the beginning, it should simplify coding in the future. And it would be good experience for working on larger and more complicated code base.

The progress is slightly slow in terms of implemented game features. Hopefully, the future development would be faster given a cleaner code base.
