# Milestone Write-up

* Application compiles and runs. Correctly uses code and shaders to render background and assets.
* Renders sprites = loading and rendering of textured geometry wiht correct blending.
* Basic 2D transformations = needed to render sprites in different locations.
* Keyboard/mouse control. Use the arrow keys to move the turtle up, left, right and down.
* 
* Smooth movement from point A to point B, use arrow keys to move the turtle, correctly accounts for time step.
* Application exits.

## Creative Component
* Bonus textures added - tiles and towers.

## Discrepancies 
* Towers do not subtract the health of any enemies. This is because we don't have a messaging system in place for ECS so we're unable to interact with the collision system which is crucial in doing any interactions between entities.
* Player does not collide with any tiles. Again, no messaging system, so we can't do any interactions between entities.
* Enemies do not translate towards player but are hard-coded to move around the map. Still figuring out how to pass data between systems.
* Base does not have destroyed game over condition because we have no messaging system in place for ECS.
* Basic collision not done because we don't have a messaging system in place which is taking more work than we thought.
